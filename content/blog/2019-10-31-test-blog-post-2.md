It's time to create your first blog post. Login to your site's **/admin/** page and create a new post by clicking New Blog. Add a title, a date and some text. When you click **Publish**, a new commit will be created in your GitHub repo with this format 

`Create Blog “year-month-date-title”`.

Then **Netlify** will detect that there was a commit in your repo, and will start rebuilding your project. When your project is deployed you'll be able to see the post you created.
